## Remaining TODOs

- [ ] Allow user to download photo to Photo album // Set the href attribute of the download button, like `document.querySelector('#dl-btn').href = imageDataURL`;
- [ ] Show an error icon if user denies permissions (use ErrorBoundary)

## EXTRAs (these are all things that could be done to improve the app)

- Image filters? ( https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/ )
- Animations
- PWA tuning
